**Hello, my name is Charles Fewlass.**

## Now
I run a wiki at scrollsoflankhmar.com which covers the works of the fantasy author, Fritz Leiber, as well as role-playing games
based on his stories. I use DokuWiki for my backend which is highly customizable with plugins. That being the case, to fill the needs
of my site, I am now working on writing some of my own plugins for DokuWiki.

## Past
As a kid, I taught myself how to program basic on a Commodore 64 in the 1980s. It was called the 64 because it had a whopping 64 bytes of ram. Those are 8-bit bytes. I then read the chapter on machine code three times before it clicked. From there, I wrote a simple game where a joystick controlled some gun sights and the trigger shot two lazers from the bottom corners of the screen while a two-dimensional spaceship flew around. My C64 game creations also included Worm on Worm (think Tron) and a chess-styled game where the players could move the squares around.
