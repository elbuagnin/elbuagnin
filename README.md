# Hi there, I'm Charles Fewlass ðŸ‘‹

## Web Developer & Digital Solutions Architect
I'm the founder of Glass Canvas Web Design, where I help small businesses, entrepreneurs, the trades, and creators obtain a professional and modern web presence without breaking the bank. In addition to doing web design for clients, I have my hands in various web ventures wherever my interests take me.

## What I am Working On
    â€¢ **Glass Canvas Web Design** - Building custom web solutions for businesses ready to elevate their online presence 
    â€¢ AI-Assisted RPGs - Exploring the intersection between tabletop-styled RPGs and AI automation.
    â€¢ Open Source Contributions - Contributing to projects that help build the web

## My Journey
My programming journey began in the 1980s with a Commodore 64, teaching myself BASIC and eventually machine code. That early experience of creating something from nothingâ€”whether it was laser-shooting spaceships or chess variantsâ€”instilled a passion for building solutions that continues to drive my work today.
From those 8-bit beginnings to modern web technologies, I've maintained the same core philosophy: technology should solve real problems and improve our lives.

## Current Focus Areas
    â€¢ Modern web development (Vue 3, Node.js, full-stack solutions) 
    â€¢ AI integration and automation 
    â€¢ User experience design 
    â€¢ Remote tabletop FRPG solutions

## Beyond Code
When I'm not coding, you'll find me:

    â€¢ Hanging outside with my dogs
    â€¢ Exploring tabletop RPGs and Euro-style board games 
    â€¢ Producing computer-based music 
    â€¢ Playing electric bass and keyboards 
    â€¢ Tending to my garden 
    â€¢ Reading across science, philosophy, history, and weird fiction

## Let's Connect
I'm always interested in discussing new projects, innovative ideas, or just connecting with fellow developers and creators. Feel free to explore my repositories or reach out if you'd like to collaborate!
