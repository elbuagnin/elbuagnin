**Hello, my name is Charles Fewlass.**

## Now
Now that I am in my fifties, how I approach tabletop role-playing games has changed. Part of that is through neccessity as my RPG friends all live in different states now. The other part is that I no longer have the motivation to learn new systems everytime our group starts a new campaign or one-shot. As such, I am working on some ideas to use game servers to facilitate a "less work" style of gaming. To support that end, I need the support of Natural Language Processors. I've landed on NPM Compromise as the ideal NLP to work with for my needs. Now I am working on modules that use the Compromise engine and modules that extend the Compromise engine to take advantage of NLP for remote tabletop role-playing.

## Past
As a kid, I taught myself how to program basic on a Commodore 64 in the 1980s. It was called the 64 because it had a whopping 64 bytes of ram. Those are 8-bit bytes. I then read the chapter on machine code three times before it clicked. From there, I wrote a simple game where a joystick controlled some gun sights and the trigger shot two lazers from the bottom corners of the screen while a two-dimensional spaceship flew around. My C64 game creations also included Worm on Worm (think Tron) and a chess-styled game where the players could move the squares around.
